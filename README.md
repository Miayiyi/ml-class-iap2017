# A Whirlwind Tour of ML
###_IAP 2017 course at MIT_

## About
This course gives a high-level overview of diverse areas of machine learning. The goal is to introduce students to core concepts and techniques in ML, and provide enough of a primer on different sub-areas of ML so that students can choose the right approach for a given problem and explore interesting topics further.

The course covers an introduction to ML, Inference, Bayesian Methods and Neural Networks. Each class is taught by graduate students or post-docs at MIT working in the specific areas.

The course was organized by [Manasi Vartak](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mvartak/) and [Maggie Makar](http://mmakar.scripts.mit.edu/mmakar/) from MIT CSAIL.

## Session I: Introduction to ML
This session gives an overview of supervised and unsupervised learning, and an introduction to probabilistic graphical models.

_Concepts_: Loss functions, Linear regression, Logistic regression, SVMs, Decision trees, Random Forests, Clustering, PCA, Graphical Models, Variable Elimination 

Taught by [Manasi Vartak](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mvartak/).
